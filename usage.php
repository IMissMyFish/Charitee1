        <h2 class = "abtHead">Purpose</h2>
        <h3 class = "abtBody">Charitee is a social media platform specifically for the promotion and discovery of nonprofits. </h3>

      <div id = "storyAbt" class = "abtcrSec">
        <h2 class = "abtHead">Nonprofits</h2>
        <h3 class = "abtBody"> We give nonprofits the ability to use our platform like a short personal blog, posting updates about what they are doing and how they are impacting their community. Nonprofits are also encouraged to update the subsections provided for them on their profile so that potential donors can see more ways to get involved with the nonprofits that they discover. The subsections include events, fundraisers and volunteer oppurtunities. We will use locations tags and preferences to connect nonprofits to donors. We believe that helping nonprofits talk and build relationships to donors is an important to the fostering good will in the community</h3>

      <div id = "teamAbt" class = "abtcrSec">
        <h2 class = "abtHead">Donors</h2>
        <h3 class = "abtBody"> We give donors an easy-to-use platform, so that they may quickly and efficiently be able to find nonprofits that interest them. The donor will answer a simple 3 question survey, that will then recommend them nonprofits based on their preferences. We wanted our users to be able to connect with like-minded nonprofits, so that they may better engage and impact the communities that are important to them. Giving is an essential part of a loving culture, so why not make it easier and more accesible?</h3>

        <h2 class = "abtHead">Our Story</h2>
        <h3 class = "abtBody">Charitee was born late August 2017 when co-founders, Peyton and Vincent, met at Florida State University. The two had grown up very involved in their local nonprofit sectors spending a lot of their spare time volunteering. One day, while they talked about those experiences and the troubles they had observed in the small nonprofits they had worked with; they knew there had to be something they could do to help. That solution is Charitee! The team then went out into the Tallahassee community to spread the word and get feedback on their idea. This process helped to shape Charitee into what it is today.</h3>

      <div id = "teamAbt" class = "abtcrSec">
        <h2 class = "abtHead">Our Team</h2>
        <h3 class = "abtBody">The Chariteam is comprised of 3 students from Florida State University! Each and every member of our team has a passion for the nonprofit sector; all of them growing up serving their communities through volunteer service. We have used our experiences in the sector along with the knowledge and input of nonprofit executives to build Charitee.</h3>
